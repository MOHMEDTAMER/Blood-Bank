						<h4>Importance Of Donation</h4>
						<h5>Donating blood is a crucial way to save lives.
							It is necessary for women with complications during pregnancy and childbirth, children with severe anemia, accident victims, and cancer patients.
							A steady supply of blood is essential since it can only be stored for a limited amount of time before use.
							To ensure that blood is always available when needed, it is important for healthy people to donate regularly.
							Blood donation is the most generous gift anyone can give another person - the gift of life. By donating your blood, you can potentially save one or even multiple lives if your blood is separated into its components - red cells, platelets, and plasma - which can be used individually for patients with specific conditions.
						</h5>

						<h4>Recipient Safety</h4>
						<h5>Donors are evaluated for potential health risks that could make the donation unsafe for the recipient.
							This includes controversial restrictions such as barring men who have sex with men (MSM) from donating blood due to the risk of transmitting HIV.
							In 2011, the UK (excluding Northern Ireland) modified its blanket ban on MSM donors to a more limited restriction which only prevents MSM from donating blood if they have had sex with other men within the past year.
							The US followed suit in late 2015 when the FDA made a similar change. In 2017, both countries further reduced their restrictions to three months.
							Autologous donors are not always screened for recipient safety problems since the donor is the only person who will receive the blood.

						<h4>Donor Safety</h4>
						<h5>The donor is carefully screened and asked questions about their medical history to ensure that donating blood is safe for them.
							Their hemoglobin or hematocrit levels are tested to make sure they won't become anemic from the blood loss, and the American Red Cross requires a hemoglobin level between 12.5g/dL (for females) and 13.0g/dL (for males) to 20.0g/dL for donations.
							Pulse, blood pressure, and body temperature are also evaluated, and elderly donors may be deferred due to health concerns.
							Furthermore, weight and height are important factors in determining eligibility; the American Red Cross requires a donor to be at least 110 pounds (50 kg) for whole blood and platelet donation, 130 pounds (59 kg) (males).</h5>
